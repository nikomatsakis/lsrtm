# FFI

FFI = "Foreign Function Interface"

Ability to call *in-process* between languages

---

# Do you really *want* FFI?

Alternatives:

* HTTP
* Microservices
* IPC -- see [JSII](https://github.com/aws/jsii)

---

# Reasons to use FFI

* Vended libraries

--
* Sharing large data structures, high perf requirements

--
* Testing code

---

# Cautionary tales

# Special role for C

* C has historically been the "lingua franca"
* Rust can do the same!

---

# PART 1: Calling C from Rust, easy case

# C FFI PART 1: Key points

* `extern "C" { .. }`
    * Unsafe to call
* Linking
    * If you are calling a system library, reach out and follow best practices

---

# C FFI PART 2: Calling Rust from C

---

# C FFI PART 2: Key points

* An `extern "C"` Rust function uses C ABI
* 
* Things to watch out for
    * Unhandled panic
    * setjmp, longjmp, C++ exceptions
        * Unwinding across a "C" boundary is
