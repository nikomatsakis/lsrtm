# How to participate

## Have a question?

* Do not use chime chat!
    * Start a ðŸ§µ in slack channel `#learn-some-rust-this-month-interest`!
    * Better yet, come on video!

# FFI

FFI = "Foreign Function Interface"

Ability to call *in-process* between languages

---

# Do you really *want* FFI?

Alternatives:

* HTTP
* Microservices
* IPC -- see [JSII](https://github.com/aws/jsii)

---

# Reasons to use FFI

* Vended libraries

--
* Sharing large data structures, high perf requirements

--
* Testing code

---

# Special role for C

* C has historically been the "lingua franca"
* Rust can do the same!

---

# PART 1: Calling C from Rust, easy case

---

# C FFI PART 1: Key points

* `extern "C" { .. }`
    * Unsafe to call
* Linking
    * If you are calling a system library, reach out and follow best practices

---

# C FFI PART 2: Calling Rust from C

---

# C FFI PART 2: Key points

* An `extern "C"` Rust function uses C ABI
* 
* Things to watch out for
    * Unhandled panic
    * setjmp, longjmp, C++ exceptions
        * Unwinding across a "C" boundary is

# C FFI PART 3: Key points

* Struct layout: `#[repr(C)]`

# Bindgen

[rust-lang/rust-bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/)

Autogenerate external declarations from C header files.

---

# CBindgen

[mozilla/cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen)

> cbindgen creates C/C++11 headers for Rust libraries which expose a public C API.

```bash
> cargo install cbindgen
> cbindgen
```

---

# Wrapping external libraries

Best practices:

* Use `pkg-config` crate to probe for the library on system
* If you want to *vendor* (package the sources):
    * Include an env variable to disable vendoring
    * Only do it *after* `pkg-config` has a chance to look for the library
* Create a `foo-sys` that *just* exports the C APIs, and a `foo` that is more Rust-like and nice.

* Macro generates:
    * a header file (`main.rs.h`) C++ code can include
    * Rust code to reflect the C++ declarations
