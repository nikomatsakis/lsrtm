# Learn Some Rust This Month

"Learn Some Rust This Month" is a series of presentations given at Amazon on a (roughly) monthly basis explaining various aspects of Rust.

Since the material is almost entirely generic Rust content, I put any slides that I create here -- please take a look and see if it's useful to you!

This isn't meant as a coherent course per se nor as a complete archive of slides: for example, many presentations are not given by me.
